# Select random winners

## Init

This project is generated by AI with the following prompt:

```
generate c program that reads a text file (= input param) and outputs random x-number of lines (= input param 2)
the idea is that on each line in the text file a nickname is written and x "winners" are randomly choosen from the input file, if one nickname is already picked and added to the winners list it shouldn't be selected again
if the x (number of winners) is bigger then the number of lines, output a usefull error message
```

The initlal generation was executed with the `Claude Opus 4.5` model. But it contained a few bugs, for example the second line was never selected when running the program with:
- input file of 7 lines
- number of winners set to 6

## Opencode

Installed Opencode to fix the bugs and add some error handling. 
After some iterations, the the final code is available in the `random-winners.c` file.


# Usage

Run the program with the following command:

```
./random-winners <input_file> <number_of_winners>
```

Where `<input_file>` is the path to the text file containing the nicknames (one nickname per line) and `<number_of_winners>` is the number of random winners you want to select.
